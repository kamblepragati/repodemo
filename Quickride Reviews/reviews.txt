Idea is good. But the implementation is not up to the mark..if some better app comes, people will definitely will switch over.

It's great! Saving time and money both. One suggestion. If you can show the driver the real time location of customer. Would help a lot.

Useful , and easy to use. Nowadays share charges are increasing, app owner should keep a check on this.

The app still lacks the accuracy of the features like route & time which is important.

Best app. Experience was awesome. I am using it daily. I guess number of people who takes rides have become. Who offers ride are less. If it's equal then it will be great. I appreciate who has brought this app to use. Thank you so much.

Fantastic app for ride sharing in bangalore. Best part is that car costs are shared. Map routing has to be improved. I do not see a right turn from Sarjapur Rd into Ring road. It suggests a long U turn

Everything is excellent. Just to improve. I recommended to make the alphabet and other icons sizeto be increased. It helps to understand easily while driving the car, without any hassle, eventually helps in concentrating on driving.

Very nice app for carpooling. Would appreciate if you can enable voice commands, when a ride has been started; to make the drive safe.

Everything else is fine. But your notification tone, horrible. Ruins my day.

4 star bcz others get to know ur phone numbers. There should be a facility where the call has to be made by the app or u morphe ur actual no

Amazing service in the Bangalore region. Saves both time nd money and also gives friends. But needs to reach a lot of people as many don't know it's potential

The major issue I find is that when you send a message over chat, the other user doesn't get a notification even when he has set conversation notifications on in settings.

Though the app is good, there are few bugs. It is not refreshing properly on time. Also there are lots of route between destinations, we have options of choosing the route while creating the ride. It's creating lots of choas when we don't know the route details

23.Vijayanthi Pidaparthi

The app stucks sometimes but is quite useful, an idea : please put a feature to consider alternative routes between 2 destinations and the prices accordingly

Love it. Really great car pooling app. It will be good if you adopt new technologies for voice based booking and precision over map and the app performance in peak time.

This app is really helpful yet there are few bugs that annoy the users a little. Like we will have to force close the app or shut down the app at times to really see the updated status of the rides or the passengers on that ride. Also, live tracking of the car gets a little funny when the orient...
